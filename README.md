# programming-test-compiling
This is the repository for uploading my answer to GSOC JdeRobot programming-test-compiling question.

## Log
The compile and running log (bash input & output) are in the file compile-shell-log & running-shell-log. The format is sometimes a bit messy, because Ubuntu terminal uses some special characters to align the text.<br>
The bash command history is in the bash_history. It is copied from  ~/.bash_history

## screenshot
Screenshot is cameraview_screenshot.png in the repository<br>
The cameraserver is configured to publish camera images on 127.0.0.1:9999, and the cameraview is receiving the image with frame rate = 10
